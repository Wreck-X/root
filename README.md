Root
---

Root is the central backend service for our club’s infrastructure. It acts as a unified data layer, handling communication between services like [Home](https://www.github.com/amfoss/home), [amD](https://www.github.com/amfoss/amd), and [Presense](https://www.github.com/amfoss/presense). Each frontend or end-user application is designed to be self-contained, relying on Root for data access without being tightly coupled to it. This modular approach reduces the risk of a complete infrastructure failure — unlike our previous CMS — though some features may still be affected if Root goes down.

# Quick Setup

1. Install prerequisites:
   - Rust (latest stable should work fine)
   - PostgreSQL
   - SQLx CLI: `cargo install sqlx-cli`

2. Configure environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   ```
   - Make sure that you have a postgres database running with the specified credentials.

3. Setup database:
   ```bash
   sqlx database create
   sqlx migrate run
   ```

4. Run server:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

GraphQL playground should be available at `http://localhost:8000/graphiql` as long as it's in development mode.

# Deployment
The deployed instance can be accessed at [root.amfoss.in](https://root.amfoss.in).

The `production` branch is exclusively meant for production use and commits which get merged into it will make their way into the deployed instance. Active development should occur on the `develop` branch and when sufficient stability has been achieved, they can be merged into `production`. This will kick off the deployment workflow.

Further details can be found at [bedrock](https://github.com/amfoss/bedrock).

## Reporting Issues

If you encounter a bug, please check existing issues first to avoid duplicates. If none exist, create a new issue with the following details:

* Title: Concise summary.
* Description: A detailed description of the issue.
* Steps to Reproduce: If it's a bug, include steps to reproduce.
* Expected and Actual Behavior: Describe what you expected and what actually happened.

## Suggesting Features

We welcome new ideas! Please open an issue titled "Feature Request: `<Feature Name>`" and provide:

* Problem: What problem does this feature solve?
* Solution: Describe how you envision it working.
* Alternatives Considered: Mention any alternatives you've considered.

## Submitting Code Changes

If you'd like to fix a bug, add a feature, or improve code quality:

* Check the open issues to avoid redundancy.
* Open a draft PR if you'd like feedback on an ongoing contribution.
* **Make sure to set the `develop` branch as your pull request target**, see [Deployment](#deployment)

## Coding Standards

* Follow Rust Conventions: Use idiomatic Rust patterns. Use `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` to format and lint your code.
* Modularity: Write modular, reusable functions. Avoid monolithic code.
* Descriptive Naming: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and types.
* Don't worry too much about rules, it just needs to be pretty. Most editors have built-in tools to do this for you.
